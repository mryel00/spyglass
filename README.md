A simple mjpeg server for Picamera2.

With Spyglass you are able to stream videos from a camera that is supported by [libcamera](http://libcamera.org) like
the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/).

Current version: 0.13.0

## Prerequisites

-   Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye
-   [Picamera2](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2) - Already installed on Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye
-   Python 3.8+
-   A camera supported by libcamera and connected to the Raspberry Pi

## Quick Start

The server can be started with

```shell
./run.py
```

This will start the server with the following default configuration:

-   Address the server binds to: 0.0.0.0
-   Port: 8080
-   Resolution: 640x480
-   Framerate: 15fps
-   Stream URL: /stream
-   Snapshot URL: /snapshot

## Configuration

On startup the following arguments are supported:

| Argument                      | Description                                                                                         | Default      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `-b`, `--bindaddress`         | Address where the server will listen for new incoming connections.                                  | `0.0.0.0`    |
| `-p`, `--port`                | Port where the server will listen for new incoming connections.                                     | `8080`       |
| `-r`, `--resolution`          | Resolution of the captured frames. This argument expects the format <width>x<height>                | `640x480`    |

| `-sn`, `--snapshot_url`       | Sets the URL for snapshots (single frame of stream).                                                | `/snapshot`  |
| `-af`, `--autofocus`          | Autofocus mode. Supported modes: `manual`, `continuous`                                             | `continuous` |
| `-l`, `--lensposition`        | Set focal distance. 0 for infinite focus, 0.5 for approximate 50cm. Only used with Autofocus manual | `0.0`        |
| `-s`, `--autofocusspeed`      | Autofocus speed. Supported values: `normal`, `fast`. Only used with Autofocus continuous            | `normal`     |
| `-ud` `--upsidedown`          | Rotate the image by 180° (see below)                                                                |              |
| `-fh` `--flip_horizontal`     | Mirror the image horizontally (see below)                                                           |              |
| `-fv` `--flip_vertical`       | Mirror the image vertically (see below)                                                             |              |
| `-or` `--orientation_exif`    | Set the image orientation using an EXIF header (see below)                                          |              |
| `-tf` `--tuning_filter`       | Set a tuning filter file name.                                                                      |              |
| `-tfd` `--tuning_filter_dir`  | Set the directory to look for tuning filters.                                                       |              |
Starting the server without any argument is the same as

```shell
./run.py -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 -r 640x480 -f 15 -st '/stream' -sn '/snapshot' -af continuous -l 0.0 -s normal
```

The stream can then be accessed at `http://<IP of the server>:8080/stream`

### Maximum resolution

Please note that the maximum recommended resolution is 1920x1080 (16:9).

The absolute maximum resolution is 1920x1920. If you choose a higher resolution spyglass may crash.

### Image Orientation

There are two ways to change the image orientation.

To use the ability of picamera2 to transform the image you can use the following options when starting spyglass:
 * `-ud` or `--upsidedown` - Rotate the image by 180°
 * `-fh` or `--flip_horizontal` - Mirror the image horizontally
 * `-fv` or `--flip_vertical` - Mirror the image vertically

Alternatively you can create an EXIF header to modify the image orientation. Most modern browsers should respect the
this header.

Use the `-or` or `--orientation_exif` option and choose from one of the following orientations
 * `h` - Horizontal (normal)
 * `mh` - Mirror horizontal
 * `r180` - Rotate 180
 * `mv` - Mirror vertical
 * `mhr270` - Mirror horizontal and rotate 270 CW
 * `r90` - Rotate 90 CW
 * `mhr90` - Mirror horizontal and rotate 90 CW
 * `r270` - Rotate 270 CW

For example to rotate the image 90 degree clockwise you would start spyglass the following way:
```shell
./run.py -or r90
```

### Tuning filter
Tuning filters are used to normalize or modify the camera image output, for example, using an NoIR camera can lead to a pink color, whether applying a filter to it you could remove its tone pink. More information here: https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/blob/main/examples/tuning_file.py


Predefined filters can be found at one of the picamera2 directories:
- ~/libcamera/src/ipa/rpi/vc4/data
- /usr/local/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4
- /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4
- /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/raspberrypi

You can also define your own directory of filter by using parameter `tuning_filter_dir`.

list the files present there and you can use it in our config. eg.: `ov5647_noir.json`


## Using Spyglass with Mainsail

If you want to use Spyglass as a webcam source for [Mainsail]() add a webcam with the following configuration:

-   URL Stream: `/webcam/stream`
-   URL Snapshot: `/webcam/snapshot`
-   Service: `V4L-MJPEG`

## Install as application

If you want to install Spyglass globally on your machine you can use `python -m pip install .` to do so.

## Install and run as a service

### Install

Quite simple:

```bash
cd ~/spyglass
make install
```

This will ask you for your `sudo` password.\
After install is done, please reboot to ensure service starts properly

To uninstall the service simply use

```bash
cd ~/spyglass
make uninstall
```

#### Using Moonraker Update Manager

To be able to use Moonraker update manager, add the following lines to moonraker.conf:

```conf
[update_manager spyglass]
type: git_repo
channel: beta
path: ~/spyglass
origin: https://github.com/roamingthings/spyglass.git
managed_services: spyglass
```
> Make sure moonraker.asvc contains `spyglass` in the list: `cat ~/printer_data/moonraker.asvc | grep spyglass`.
> 
> If not there execute: `make upgrade-moonraker`

### Configuration

You should find a configuration file in `~/printer_data/config/spyglass.conf`.

Please see [spyglass.conf](resources/spyglass.conf) for an example

### Restart the service

To restart the service use `systemctl`:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart spyglass
```

## Start Developing

If you want to setup your environment for development perform the following steps:

Setup your Python virtual environment:
```shell
python -m venv .venv                  # Create a new virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate                  # Activate virtual environment
python -m pip install --upgrade pip   # Upgrade PIP to the current version
pip install -r requirements.txt       # Install application dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt  # Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # Install development dependencies
```

The project uses [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) to check commit messages to comply with
[Conventional Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org). When installing the development dependencies git-hooks will be
set up to check commit messages pre commit.

### Problems when Committing to your Branch

 You may get the following error message when you try to push to your branch:
 ```
 fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/HEAD..HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
 Use '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:
 'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'
 ```
 This error occurs when your HEAD branch is not properly set ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8841024))
 To fix this run the following command:
 ```shell
 git remote set-head origin -a
 ```
